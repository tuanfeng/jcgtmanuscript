The 3D printing technique provides a powerful solution to prototype customized objects with fine surface details and complex interior structures. However, the spread and development of this technique is hindered to the high cost of material and low speed of fabrication. Research efforts have been devoted to reduce the material used, i.e., the volume/weight of object, and the key challenge here is to keep the stiffness while less material is used. Given a load distribution, it is natural to hollow the object for a cost-effective purpose and add interior structure to optimize the structure stiffness-to-weight ratio \cite{stava:2012,wang:2013,Lu:2014}. Such load-distribution-based techniques have been highly successful in ideal cases as prefectly minimizing the structural deformation/stress with much less material in real world plysical test with corresponding preset loads. However, they are not suitable for many real world applications because the loads on a fabricated object may appear in other distributions which are different from the preset one. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:teaser:a}, the Trophy model could be hold in many different ways which lead to very different load distribution cases. 
 
Instead of taking one (or several) load distribution case(s) into consideration, we optimize the global stiffness-to-weight ratio by minimizing the maximum of deformation under any load distribution cases, named as unknown loads due to no load distribution case is given to be based on. We use the criterion \textit{deformation} rather than \textit{stress}, as the former is more suitable when using elastic materials like many materials in 3D printing. Such elastic property preserve the fabricated object from breaking under large stress but is much easier to be deformed when load is applied. The rationality of the deformation based formulation can coincidently be supported by pervious research as well (see details in Sec.~\ref{subsec:eigen-mode-opt}). When the amount of material is given, our unknown-load-based optimization framework aims to make the object perform the best (stiffest) among other interior design when the corresponding worst (lead to the largest deformation) load disctribution case is appied.

Our work is inspired by the research of \cite{Chen:2007} and \cite{wang:2013}. These work show that an entire object can be simulated by a frame structure consisting of a set of beams and a set of nodes connected by these beams. Frame structure captures most of the structural features of the object and has a rather small set of parameters which can be analyzed and computed with high efficiency. The last step of our framework restores the optimized frame structure back to an entity object ready to be fabricated and the global stiffness property is proved to be kept.

Prior to global stiffness optimization, we first perform a \textit{Constrained Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation} (CCVT) on the input object and obtain an isotropic initial frame by taking the edges of each tetrahedron as beam of the initial frame. The global stiffness problem is then formulated as a saddle point problem by minimizing the maximum norm of the deformation under any normalized load. Optimization on nodes positions, beam radii and nodes topology connections are applied to the frame structure using a saddle point algorithm. After optimization algorithm is terminated, we adopt a postprocess step to generate the object with original object surface and lightweight interior based on the optmized frame structure. Note that it is not simply cover a skin on the frame structure like \cite{wang:2013}. As the skin can not be analyzed efficiently, our postprocess is rather like an adaptive hollowing meanwhile adding interior supportive structure. Finally, we use the \emph{Finite Element Method} (FEM) to analyze and verify the rationality of our results.





%Such objects are difficult to fabricate using traditional manufacturing systems, which lay particular emphasis on surface processing.
%The objects with complex interior structures are difficult to be fabricated by traditional manufacture methods
%which pay more emphasis on shaping and surface processing.
%In some cases, it is required to hollow the objeect and design the interior structure for a cost-effective purpose \cite{wang:2013} or to meet specific functional goals \cite{bacher2014spin}.
%The capability of using digital representations to generate solid objects with fine surface details and complex interior structures inspires significant effort.
%
%Technologies around 3D printing have received a lot of attention unprecedentedly and been popular since recent years.
%In practice, the 3D printing provides a powerful solution to prototype the customized objects with complex interior structure design, which opened new horizons in 3D shape design technologies for fabrication.


%The techniques of Fast Fabrication, also known as 3D printing, have been more and more developed and matured in recent year \cite{relative papers}. No matter what specified technique is used, the basic idea of 3D printing is stacking cross-section layers of an object one by one result in when comparing with traditional processing methods like CNC, etc., 3D printing is able to build complex interior structure with highly flexible. It makes the problem of interior structure design for achieving some customized properties receive a lot of attention unprecedentedly.

%As the raw material input to 3D printer remain expensive but reusable, the production cost of the resulting model is directly related to the volume of target object without much impact on the printing process (wasted material is reusable). Take this factor into consideration, the designing of cost effective 3D shapes by reducing their interior material (i.e. achieving some customized properties with minimal material cost) has been studied recently like \cite{wang:2013,buildtolast}, which is called cost-effective structure optimization.



%% 2. 以往的绝大多数相关工作，都是在指定受力下的结构分析及优化。而现实情况是，所制造物体可能会受到各种不可能预见力的作用。



%In fabrication engineering, extensive attention has been paid to shape analysis and structural optimization~\cite{Crapo:1979,Rosenberg:1980,Haftka:1986,zhou:2013}.
%Many kinds of lightweight structures, including frames and honeycombs,
%have been developed to reduce weight and reinforce strength~\cite{Kindinger:2001,song:2013,wang:2013}.
%
%However, the vast majority of previous work focuses on structural design and optimization under specified load environments, such as simulated handling, pressure, or evenly distributed force.
%
%Actually, a fabricated object might be handled or used in various possible ways,  which cannot be simulated by an exact load distribution.
%For instance, it is difficult to predict where a football would be kicked during a game and specified loads cannot emulate all cases.
%
%Due to the inability of existing forms of structural optimization to plan for all possible load distributions, current methods have obvious limitations and fail to satisfy the aforementioned situation.
%
%However, previous work on cost-effective structure optimization are focusing on the situation under some given loads including gravity and share the formulation as the given external loads act on the surface on the object to simulate handling, pressing etc., and the gravity act on everywhere of the solid.
%When operating optimization with certain loads, a solid with interior structure is generated which accounts strength under this situation. This formulation is very limited for many cases because for most of the time, people can not predict a exact load distribution when it is used after the fabrication like a football which cannot be decided where it will be kicked during the game or a mobile phone which cannot be told the exact holding position or a bridge which cannot be predict where the heavy car will go. Even for some easy case with only limited possible load distribution, no existing method can synthesize structures generated under each given load distribution. Or if we add all the possible load distributions up together for a single optimization, there is no guarantee of working for the distributions might contradict, e.g. a place on the surface could be pulled in one situation and pushed in another.

%In this paper, we proposed a novel formulation for optimize the structure under a given material bound that the designed structure will be damaged least is a bounded load under any possible most-damaged load distribution which can be also described as optimizing the worst case to the best. The designed solid is considered as an adaptive hollowing surface with cylinder-like interior supportive structure. In order to get this problem solvable, we simulate the structure via frame. The adaptive-hollowed surface is simplified as a mesh-like surface frame with different radius on each beams and the interior structure is connected beams in the surface frame.



%We propose a novel approach that formulates the structural optimization problem by maximizing the total potential energy of a target structure, consisting of an adaptive hollowed surface shell and interior supportive beams.
%
%The designed structure can be well simulated via frame structure~\cite{wang:2013}, which simply approximates the adaptive hollowed surface shell and interior beams as  a unified form.
%In order to get this problem solvable, we simulate the structure via frame.
%The adaptive hollowed surface is simplified as a mesh-like surface frame with different radius on each beams
%and the interior structure is connected beams in the surface frame.
%
%Then the structural optimization is reformulated as a saddle point model, i.e., by maximizing the minimum non-zero eigenvalue of the stiffness matrix from the designed frame structure.
%
%We present an algorithm based on the Rayleigh-quotient to solve the saddle point model efficiently and obtain the final structure with optimal design variables (i.e., the beam radii and the node position).
%
%Finally, we use the \emph{Finite Element Method} (FEM) to analyze and verify the rationality of our results.


%We utilize the dual triangulation of centroidal Voronoi diagram with uniform density function to generate an initial guess of the frame.
%
%The optimization problem adjust the frame parameter (node position and radius of beams) , essentially, to minimize the largest compliance under any load distribution.
%
%We prove that the optimization problem can be equivalent to the optimizing of critical value of Rayleigh quotient which is linear and explicit.
%
%After casting the optimization problem as mutually finding an optimal distribution of the radius of frame's edges and the position of each nodes under a total volume constrain, the result frame will lead the generation of output solid in the end.
%
%Further more, with a simple outer loop, our method is also available for the goal of minimize the material cost under the constraint of minimal load-bearing performance. We will show that the largest compliance can be calculated with the worst load distribution, a binary chop can then be added as a outer loop to find the minimal cost for a upper bound of compliance.
